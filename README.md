### 1. Audit SAST Settings

Audit SAST settings across all organizations in a group:
- Enter your Snyk Group ID when prompted
- Choose output format (JSON, Excel, or both)
- Reports will be saved with timestamps

### 2. Toggle SAST Scanning

Enable or disable SAST scanning for organizations:
- Toggle SAST for a single organization by ID
- Process multiple organizations from a file (JSON/XLSX)
- Supports organization lists from audit reports
- Interactive confirmation before making changes
- Clear success/failure feedback

Supported file formats for organization lists:
- JSON: `[{"id": "org-id", "name": "Org Name"}, ...]`
- Excel/CSV: Must contain 'id' and 'name' columns

### 3. Delete SAST Projects

Manage SAST projects with precision:
- List all SAST projects across multiple organizations
- Delete all projects or select specific ones using simple number selection
- Export projects to file before deletion
- Progress tracking for bulk operations
- Detailed success/failure reporting

Project deletion workflow:
1. View all projects with sequential numbering
2. Select projects to delete by entering numbers (e.g., "1,3,5") or type 'all' to select all
3. Confirm before deletion
4. View detailed results

Example selection:
```
1. project-1 (org-1)
2. project-2 (org-1)
3. project-3 (org-2)

Enter numbers (e.g., '1,3') or 'all': 1,3
```

Example:
```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli audit -g YOUR_GROUP_ID -o sast_audit -f both
```

### 2. Disable SAST for Organizations

Disable SAST for a single organization:

```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli disable ORG_ID
```

Disable SAST for multiple organizations from a file:

```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli disable --file organizations.txt
```

File format (one organization per line):
```
org_id_1,Organization Name 1
org_id_2,Organization Name 2
# This is a comment
org_id_3  # Name is optional
```

Options:
- `--file`, `-f`: Path to file containing organizations
- `--yes`, `-y`: Skip confirmation prompt

### 3. Manage SAST Projects

Delete specific SAST projects from an organization:

```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli delete-projects ORG_ID PROJECT_ID1 PROJECT_ID2
```

Delete all SAST projects from an organization:
```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli delete-projects ORG_ID
```

Export projects before deletion:
```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli delete-projects ORG_ID --export projects_backup.csv
```

Delete projects from a file:
```bash
python -m snyk_sast_tool.cli delete-projects ORG_ID --file projects_to_delete.txt
```

File format (one project per line):
```
project_id_1,Project Name 1
project_id_2,Project Name 2
# This is a comment
project_id_3  # Name is optional
